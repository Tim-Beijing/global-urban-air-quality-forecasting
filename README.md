# global-urban-air-quality-forecasting
This demo consists of a Jupyter Notebook that connects to Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) datasets from NOAA and OpenAQ to build a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict air quality levels using weather data via a Binary Classification [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html) model. The project's purpose is to demonstrate using two different types of ASDI datasets (files in Amazon S3 and HTTPS APIs) within a Jupyter Notebook, such as provided by Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab. This demo is NOT for scientific or health purposes.

This Jupyter Notebook can be run for free using Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab (SMSL) and open-source Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) datasets without needing an AWS account.
